# Drawing App (Tutorial Application)
This IS a tutorial application - aka, not my code. This is Project 9 in 100 Days of SwiftUI, going over some drawing option inside of SwiftUI while being combined with animations. I did, however, deviate from the tutorial a bit by swapping out the integars for doubles and scaling up the numbers so that the animations would be smoother and more grand of a change. 

## Rules/Requirements given by 100 Days of SwiftUI 

N/A, tutorial apps don't have rules or requirements since it isn't my code.
